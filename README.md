# Snake Game in C

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game written in C. The game uses basic console input/output and runs on Windows. The player controls the snake to collect fruit and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own tail.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows (due to `conio.h` and `windows.h` libraries)
- **C Compiler**: A C compiler like GCC (MinGW) or Microsoft's Visual Studio compiler.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
